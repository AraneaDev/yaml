## What is it?

Laravel config files in Yaml format.

## Troubleshooting

#### Tests are running fine in terminal but failing in the dashboard? 

You have first to remember they are being executed in isolation, and, also, the environment is not exactly the same, so things like a cache and session may affect yoru results. 

## Minimum requirements

- Laravel 5.5
- PHP 7.0
